this project is trying to accomplish making an automatic documentation downloader of the cad software 'plasticity'. i want to crawl their website for their manual or documentation about how to do all cad related tasks and download all the text on the webpages into the folder named 'docs'. the website https://doc.plasticity.xyz/ is the website we will first visit. i then want the script to click through links to all the other doc pages and recursively download the content that would be helpful to anybody trying to use the software.
