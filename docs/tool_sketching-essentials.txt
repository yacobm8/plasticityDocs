Accurate Snapping
Curves must be snaped accurately when you use the  Curves for surface modeling.
When a Vertex is snapped to a Curve or another Vertex, it turns from purple to blue-green.
To snap precisely
When moving a Vertex, hold
Ctrl
to enable snapping.
When drawing in a sketch, you can snap without holding
Ctrl
if
Object snapping
is enabled.
See
Grid and Snap
for more information.
Snap Reference Lines
When drawing, you can create temporary reference lines to aid snapping. Point the cursor to an object and tap
Shift
. Snappable reference lines will appear.
