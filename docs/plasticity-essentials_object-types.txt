1. Sketch
1. Curve
A line or curve made up of Vertices and Control Vertices is called a Curve.
To select, switch to
Edge Selection Mode
.
Multiple curves can be connected and treated as a single curve.
Displayed in blue and turns yellow when selected.
2. Vertex
The points at both ends of a Curve are called Vertices.
To select, switch to
Control Point Selection Mode
.
Displayed as purple points, turning white when selected.
When multiple vertices overlap, the point turns teal.
3. Control Vertex
Points that define the shape of a Curve are called Control Vertices.
To select, switch to
Control Point Selection Mode
.
Smaller than Vertices, displayed as purple points, turning white when selected.
Vertices and Control Vertices are connected by white lines.
Adding Control Vertices allows for more complex Curves.
4. Region
An area enclosed by Curves is called a Region.
To select, switch to
Face Selection Mode
.
Displayed as dark blue, turning light blue when selected.
Selecting a Region automatically activates the
Extrude
command.
Deleting regions deletes the curves that bound the region.
2. Solid
1. Solid
A closed solid body made of multiple faces without any holes is called a Solid.
To select, switch to
Body Selection Mode
.
Displayed as gray, with outlines turning yellow when selected.
2. Sheet
An open body made of faces with holes is called a Sheet.
Removing part of a Solid's face turns it into an open body, a Sheet.
To select, switch to
Body Selection Mode
.
Displayed as gray, with outlines turning yellow when selected.
3. Face
Each plane or curved surface that makes up Solids and Sheets is called a Face.
To select, switch to
Face Selection Mode
.
Displayed as gray, turning light yellow when selected.
Selecting a Face automatically activates
Offset Face
command.
4. Edge
The boundary lines that surround Faces are called Edges.
To select, switch to
Edge Selection Mode
.
Displayed as black lines, turning yellow when selected.
Selecting an Edge where two Faces meet automatically activates
Fillet
command. Selecting an open Edge on a Sheet automatically activates
Extend Sheet
command.
3. Image and Mesh
1. Image
Images imported using the Import function are called Images.
To select, switch to
Body Selection Mode
.
Outlines turn yellow when selected.
2. Mesh
3D data such as STL and FBX imported using the Import function are called Meshes.
To select, switch to
Body Selection Mode
.
Outlines turn yellow when selected.
