Troubleshooting Tips
üí°
Possible reasons when loft doesn't succeed
Curves are overly complex.  Rebuilding the  Curves is often the solution.
Guide Curves not touching the profiles.  Check that each connection has a blue-green dot, indicating intersection.  To ensure a precise touch, see
Object Snaps
.
Attempting to Loft a complex shape all in one go.  Design the model using simpler sub-section shapes, made with multiple Lofts. Connect surfaces using Joins or using bridge Curves with additional Lofts for example.
Too many, or not enough guide Curves. Practice helps one to get better here.  Lofts struggle if you try to force a surface to fit through too many profiles & guides. Same issue if profiles & guides are spaced too close together.
Select Curves instead of Edges. The possible options are different for Edge and Curve.
Curves are not selected in the correct order. Profiles and guides must be selected in the order in which surfaces flow.
A failed Loft is sometimes not a failure.  Generally you see the Loft growing as you select guides. However, I've had surfaces appear, then disappear, when selecting the next guides.  This leads you to think the Loft has failed. Keep going on to the next giudes and all the surfaces may suddenly appear.  It's as if Parasolid sometimes needs ALL your inputs first to solve the puzzle.
Reverse the selection sequence of Profiles and Guides.  Normally you select the Profiles and then the Guides.  When a loft fails, try selecting the "Guides" and then the "Profiles".  This can work even though it seems backwards.
