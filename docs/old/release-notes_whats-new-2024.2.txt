Reverse Command
Reverse Command is a command that allows you to reverse the direction of a curve and normal direction of a sheet. This can be useful for the
Pipe Tool
as you can reverse the direction of the Pipe when using the Scale option. Refer

Improved Command Features
Rebuild Command
Both Rebuild Face and Curve command have a new feature called
"Explicit Control"
which you can control the value of degrees and number of spans for UV direction.
"Explicit Control"
on Rebuild Curve is available on both Indie and Studio License, while on Rebuild Face is only available on Studio License. For more information on the Rebuild Command, click
here
.
XNurbs Command
Introducing a new boundary alignment option called
"Next"
, allowing you to generate a perpendicular flow of UV whenever boundary conditions are relatively flat. Additionally, XNurbs now includes an indicator to display warning messages whenever conflicting inputs are detected. For more information, click
here
.
Bridge Vertex and Curve Command
Continuity gizmo has been implemented to enhance interactivity, providing improved control and a more efficient workflow. For more information on Bridge Command, click
here
.
Square Command
Square Command now has a
"Match-CVs"
option which can produce higher quality surfaces. For more information, click
here
.
Rectangular and Radial Array
The Rectangular and Radial Array commands now support arraying faces that are part of a body. This feature is especially effective when arraying fillets. Moreover, both commands now have individually different distance modes -
Rectangular Array
(Extend
and
Spacing)
and
Radial Array
(Total
and
Spacing)
- allowing you to control the distance and spacing behaviour of duplicated objects. For more information on Rectangular Array click
here
and
here
for Radial Array.
Polygon Command
Polygon Command now remembers last used number of vertices.
Unwrap Command
The Unwrap Command now generates a flat sheet of the selected face from a solid, which can be used in conjunction with the
Deform Command
for further modifications.
Draft Command
Introducing a Gizmo feature that allows you to control the position of the reference face and provides the option to select multiple faces for drafting using the
Ctrl
button. This can be applied to non-uniform planar surfaces; however, the option to offset the reference face is not available. Refer to
here
.
Patch Command
Patch Command can now create sheets from a close edge selection of a solid. Refer to
here
.
Removed Commands
Rebuild Edge Command
It was removed due to its unsafe implementation and replaced with the delete command for edges -
X
,
Shift+X
,
Delete
,
Shift+Delete
keyboard buttons. This strategy should allow for the joining of more fractured edges.
Outliner
Construction Planes
- Construction Planes can now be renamed in the Outliner, allowing for better organization and management. This improvement removes unnecessary steps when searching for the correct plane, streamlining task selection and workflow. For more information on Construction Planes, click
here
.
Meshes and Images
- The Outliner now separates meshes and images into their own sections instead of categorizing them as "empties."
Context Menu for Selected Items in the Outliner
- The context menu, accessible with the right mouse button, now includes a new option: "Move selected items to root" when you have selected items in a group.
Context Menu for Group
- The context menu in the Outliner, accessed with the right mouse button, now includes two new grouping functions:
"Group selection here"
and
"Group selection at root.
Grouping items
- If all selected items are in the same group, creating a new group will place it in the same directory; otherwise, the new group will be located in the root directory.
Group Hierarchy
- Deleting a group now moves its child items to the immediate parent group rather than to the root directory.
Assigning Material
- Transparent materials are now displayed with 50% transparency, even when using both default and custom
matcaps
in non-render mode.
File Formats Enhancement
OBJ
Exporting OBJ files with UVs and an MTL file in Plasticity is now possible.
STEP
Exporting STEP files in Plasticity with colors and assembly information, such as groups, is now possible to do.
Importing STEP files in Plasticity now preserves the colors.
Meshes and Images
Snapping to Meshes and Images are now possible to do in Plasticity.

Plasticity Files (.plasticity)
Importing and Appending Plasticity documents preserves groups, names, and materials.
Parasolid (.*x_t/x_b)
Importing Parasolid files into Plasticity now supports colors, names, and assemblies, but does not yet support instances.
New Supported Formats
Importing and Exporting 3MF is supported.
Importing SVG is supported.

Minor Changes
Offset Edge Gizmo
- A new Offset Edge gizmo, resembling the two-sided fillet gizmo, has been introduced.
Copy and Paste
- The Copy and Paste command now inherits the material and name from the original object.
Alternative-Duplicate
- The Alternative-Duplicate command for faces now also inherits the name and material.
Text Tool
- The Text tool has been updated to include several additional fonts.
Touchpad
- The touchpad can now be used with the cursor track orbit point.
Autosave Option
- A new Autosave option allows you to save the current file every X minutes, with the interval configurable in the Preferences section.
Incremental Snapping
- When
Snap to Grid
is enabled, the X (Red), Y (Green), and Z (Blue) arrows will snap to increment units along their respective axes. Meanwhile, the white circle, which by default the pivot point is centred, will snap to the absolute grid increments rather than moving the entire object incrementally. For more information on Grid and Snap, click
here
.
Midplane Construction
- You can now create a midplane construction plane by averaging the positions of at least two parallel opposing faces and regions. For more information on Construction Planes, click
here
.
Group Command
The Group Command now features a new behaviour where items under the same parent group are automatically grouped together. Additionally, when a group is deleted within the same hierarchy, its child items are moved to the parent group.
Measurements and Measurements Panel
Measurements Enhancement
- Measurements can now be moved when selected in the Outliner and used in conjunction with the Move Command, enabling you to enter specific values directly in the viewport for more precise adjustments.
Measurements Enhancement
- Measurements can be copied to clipboard in user's preferred units.
Measurement Panel
- Measurement Panel now displays the angle between two planes.
Surface Class
- Lower-right panel in the Measurements Panel now introduces surface class, allowing specific selection of faces.
