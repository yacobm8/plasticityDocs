Shape:
Specify the shape of the extended surface. Options
Natural
,
Linear
,
Soft
, and
Reflective
will directly influence the shape and curvature of the extended surface during extrusion.
Natural:
Extends the surface "naturally" by continuing the shape described by the original surface just before the start of the extension.
Linear:
Extends the surface in a flat, straight line from the boundary edge, maintaining the current tangent direction without altering curvature.
Soft:
Gradually blends the extension with the existing surface for a smooth transition, preserving both tangent and curvature.
Reflective:
Mirrors the surface curvature and tangency for a symmetrical and seamless continuation, ideal for maintaining surface symmetry.
Distance:
Specify the distance to extend.
Modify:
When enabled, the Sheet becomes a single Sheet.
