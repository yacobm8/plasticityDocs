Guide method:
Point:
The cross-section of the swept body is rotated and scaled so that the points initially coincident with the guide and path always remain in contact.
Chord:
The cross-section is rotated but not scaled.
Curve:
The cross-section is rotated but not scaled. The guide and path must touch the profile. The profile stays in contact with both guide wires, but only one of the contact points is at a fixed
point on the profile; the other is free to move along the profile.
Note: The profile must be large enough to span the greatest distance between the two guide wires.
Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.
The object created depends on the initial selection.
If you select Regions and Faces, a Solid is created.
