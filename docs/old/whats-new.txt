Plasticity 25.1 Release Notes
Plasticity 25.1 introduces a wide array of enhancements and new features aimed at improving surface modeling workflows, enhancing usability, and streamlining the user experience. Below is a detailed overview of the updates:
1. New Commands
New Slide Command
CV Sliding on Curves and Solids
Users can slide control vertices (CVs) on spline curves and surface hulls, guided by the direction of the CVs, allowing for precise adjustments during modeling.

New Section Analysis Command
Section Analysis
Section Analysis is a feature that allows users to slice through their 3D model to reveal its interior structure. This helps identify whether internal components are properly aligned or interfering with each other. It is especially useful for architectural, engineering, and design visualization.

2. Modeling Enhancements
Square Command Updates
New "Free" Option
Introducing a new continuity option that trades G0 precision for higher surface quality.
"Adjacent" Boundary Option
Introducing a new boundary condition that uses adjacent trimmed edges for creating smoother transitions.
"Tension" Feature
Introducing a new feature that allows users to adjust surface curvature tension, similar to tools in Lofting and Bridging workflows. This provides greater control over surface shaping.
Refit Trimmed Surfaces
The Square command can rebuild any four-sided trimmed surface with user-specified Degree, Span, and Continuity settings. Acting as a refit tool, it naturally aligns the splines of the trimmed surface to match its internal shape.

Xnurbs Enhancements
"Adjacent" Boundary Option
Introducing a new boundary condition that uses adjacent trimmed edges for creating smoother transitions.
"Tension" Feature
Introducing a new feature that allows users to adjust surface curvature tension, similar to tools in Lofting and Bridging workflows. This provides greater control over surface shaping.
Learn more
CV Move Editing
Proportional and Mirrored Transformations
The Move command allows proportional editing of surface CVs and supports mirrored transformations.
Learn more
Raise Degree Command Enhancement
The
Raise Degree
command can now be executed when a surface CV is selected.
Toggle Points Command Enhancement
The
Toggle Points
command can now be executed when a curve CV is selected.
3. Sketching and Curve Tools
Curve Rebuild Enhancement
Weight Option
The Rebuild command now includes a new option
"Weight"
when using explicit control to rebuild a curve.
Learn more
Snapping Enhancements
New Tangent Snapping
Introducing
Tan/Tan
snapping for ellipses and general splines.
New "Control Point" Snap Option
A new
"Control point"
snap is now available in the
"Object Snaps"
subpanel.
Learn more
Sketching Enhancement
Region Deletion Behavior
Deleting regions now automatically removes the curves that bound them.
Trimming Optimization
Trimming operations for densely packed 2D sketches, where overlapping or interfering lines make trimming difficult or slow, the Trim tool is now slightly faster and optimized for these cases.
4. Transformation Tools
Transform Command Enhancements
Stored Transform Pivots
Transformation pivots are now saved with objects when using Move, Rotate and Scale commands.
Customizable Transform Options
Users can specify the transform orientation (
Local
,
CPlane
,
World
) and pivot point (
Bounding Box
,
Median
,
Last Selected
), offering greater flexibility in transformations.

5. Surface Tools
Sheet Extension Enhancements
New "Natural" Mode
Introducing a new
"Natural"
mode for extending sheets.
Surface Extension
Surface extension modes can now be toggled using the
Tab
key.
Learn more
Construction Plane Enhancement
Users can now create a construction plane that passes through two selected points and aligns with the camera view. Ideal for planarizing a hull while maintaining alignment with the view direction.
Learn more
Bridge Surface
New "Tension" Option
New
"Tension"
option now available for Bridge Surface command.

6. Selection Conversion
Selection Conversion Enhancement
New Conversion Options
Selecting a wire body now allows conversion to points (Vertex and Control-Vertex) and vice versa, while regions can be converted into their bounding curves.
Learn more
7. User Interface and Usability Enhancements
New User Interface Design
Plasticity has been updated with a modern, streamlined UI while retaining key functional elements from previous versions. Features are now better positioned and equipped with intuitive new icons to enhance usability and workflow efficiency. This update also lays the foundation for future UI improvements.
