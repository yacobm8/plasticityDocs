Command Dialog
Shape:
Specify the shape of the extended curve. Options
Natural
,
Linear
,
Soft
,
Reflective
, and
Arc
will directly influence the shape and curvature of the extended curve during extrusion.
Natural:
Extends the curve "naturally" by continuing the curve described by the original curve just before the start of the extension.
Linear:
Extends the curve in a flat, straight line from the boundary point, maintaining the current tangent direction without altering curvature.
Soft:
Gradually blends the extension with the existing curve for a smooth transition, preserving both tangent and curvature.
Reflective:
Mirrors the curvature and tangency of the curve for a symmetrical and seamless continuation, ideal for maintaining curve symmetry.
Arc:
Extends the curve in a circular arc from the boundary point.
Distance:
Specify the distance.
Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.
