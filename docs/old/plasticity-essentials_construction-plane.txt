Construction Planes
Curves are created on the active construction plane.
Construction planes can be the XY, YZ, or XZ planes, and you can also create new ones.
Using the XY, YZ, and XZ planes
Numpad 7
: Use the XY plane. This gives you a top-down view.
Numpad 3
: Use the YZ plane. This gives you a view from the right.
Numpad 1
: Use the XZ plane. This gives you a front view.
1. Creating a Construction Plane Aligned to a Surface
You can create a construction plane that aligns with the Face of a Solid or Sheet.
Select the Face or Region you want to use as a construction plane.
Press
Space
.
The construction plane is created.
Your view will align with the created construction plane.
If you don't want to change your view, press
Shift + Space
instead of
Space
.

2. Creating a Perpendicular Construction Plane via Face and Edge Selection
You can create a construction plane that aligns perpendicular with a surface by selecting a face and edge.
Select the Face and Edge you want to use as a construction plane.
Press
Space
.
The construction plane is created.
Your view will align with the created construction plane.
If you don't want to change your view, press
Shift + Space
instead of
Space

Tip
Selecting a face acts as a reference for aligning the view, while selecting an edge provides a directional guide to orient the view.
3. Creating a Midplane Construction Plane from Opposing Parallel Faces
You can create a construction plane based on the average position of opposing parallel faces and regions resulting in a midplane construction.
Select at least two opposing Faces or Regions you want to use as a midplane construction plane.
Press
Space
.
The midplane construction plane is created.
Your view will align with the created construction plane.
If you don't want to change your view, press
Shift + Space
instead of
Space
.

4. Creating a Construction Plane from Multiple Points
You can create a construction plane based on two or more points.
Select at least two points that you want to use as a construction plane.
Press
Space
.
If you selected two points, a construction plane (CPlane) will be created that passes through the two selected points and remains parallel to the camera. This is particularly useful for aligning a surface or hull to the current view direction.
If you selected three points, a construction plane will be created at the exact position. If you selected four or more points, the plane will be created at their averaged position.
Your view will align with the created construction plane.
If you don't want to change your view, press
Shift + Space
instead of
Space
.
You can also select a Region of a sketch to create a construction plane aligned with it.

5. Creating a Construction Plane Aligned to the Current View
You can create a construction plane that aligns with your current view in the workspace:
5.1 Creating a Construction Plane through the World Origin
Position your view to the desired line of sight for the construction plane.
Press
Ctrl + Space
.
The construction plane is created.
Your browser does not support video tags.
5.2 Creating a Construction Plane through a Selected Point
Position your view to the desired line of sight for the construction plane.
Press
Ctrl + Shift + Space
.
Click on the origin of the construction plane you want to create.
The construction plane is created.

6. Saving and Utilizing Construction Planes
You can save your created construction planes for later use.
6.1 Saving Construction Planes
Click on
Temporary construction plane
at the top of the screen.
Custom plane 0
will be added to the Outliner classified as "Planes" and in the right side of the screen in "Added Planes" menu.
6.2 Utilizing Saved Construction Planes
Click on
Custom plane 0
on the right side of the screen.
The saved construction plane becomes active.
Double-clicking on
Custom plane 0
will activate the saved construction plane and align your view with it.
6.3 Renaming Construction Planes
Double click on the saved construction plane in the Outliner.
Rename the construction plane and press Enter or Left Mouse Button on the 3D viewport.
