In Command Bar
Move objects using Move Gizmo. Options for single-axis constraints or
freestyle movement
are available. The pivot is also adjustable.
Basic Usage
Select the objects you want to move.w
Press
G
.
Use the displayed Move Gizmo to move.
Set the options in the Command Dialog and Keyboard Shortcuts.
Command Dialog
XYZ:
Specify the amount of movement of the X, Y, and Z axes.
Orientation:
Set the orientation of the move gizmo.
Normal:
Sets the orientation to align with the object's surface normal.
Pivot:
Sets the orientation to match the previously defined pivot orientation.
Construction Plane:
Sets the orientation to align with the active construction plane.
World:
Sets the orientation to align with the global (world) axis.
Pivot:
Set the position of the pivot point.
Bbox:
Positions the pivot at the center of the bounding box enclosing the selected objects.
Median:
Positions the pivot at the average location of the pivots of the selected objects.
Active:
Positions the pivot at the last selected (active) object's pivot.

Tips
To move selected objects to the origin, press:
G
(Move) >
F
> right-click > right-click.
To move an object to the origin based on a selected point, press:
G
(Move) >
F
> Click the object's point > right-click.
Freestyle Move
This command is equivalent to the
F
option of the
Move
command.
Select the objects you want to move.
Use the
Freestyle Move
command in the Command Palette.
Click the starting point and endpoint to determine the direction and distance of movement.
Set the options in the Command Dialog and Keyboard Shortcuts.
The option is the same as the
Move
command.
Confirm with OK in the Command Dialog or right-click.

Left of Command Bar
Move Control Points that are laid on a surface using Move Gizmo. Options for single-axis constraints or
freestyle movement
and Proportional Editing are available. The orientation of the Move Gizmo and Pivot placement is also adjustable.
Basic Usage

Command Dialog
XYZ:
Specify the amount of movement of the X, Y, and Z axes.
Orientation:
Set the orientation of the Move Gizmo.
Normal:
Sets the orientation to align with the object's surface normal.
Pivot:
Sets the orientation to match the previously defined pivot orientation.
Construction Plane:
Sets the orientation to align with the active construction plane.
World:
Sets the orientation to align with the global (world) axis.
Pivot:
Set the position of the pivot point.
Bbox:
Positions the pivot at the center of the bounding box enclosing the selected objects.
Median:
Positions the pivot at the average location of the pivots of the selected objects.
Active:
Positions the pivot at the last selected (active) object's pivot.
Proportional:
A feature that provides multiple proportional editing options, influencing how CVs (control vertices) are affected when moved.
None:
No proportional effect; only the selected CVs move.
All:
Affects all CVs on the surface and their movement. Specify the falloff value of U and V for better proportional falloff control.
Selected:
Applies proportional editing to the selected CVs, affecting their movement. Specify the falloff value of U and V for better proportional falloff control.
Falloff U:
Specify the falloff amount in U direction.
Falloff V:
Specify the falloff amount in V direction.
Mirror:
Apply a mirror effect relative to the active
construction plane
. The mirroring axes adapt to either the global construction plane or a custom-defined construction plane.
None:
No mirror plane is specified.
X/Y/Z:
Mirror in either X, Y, and Z axes.

Note
When proportionally editing surface CVs, the last active CV selection determines the pivot position. Keep this in mind, as it affects how proportional editing behaves.
The Proportional Move command moves control vertices based on UV distance along the hull, rather than geometric distance.
