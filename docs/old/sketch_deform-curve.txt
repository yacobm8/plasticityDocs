‚ÑπÔ∏è
Scale and Offset uses a
UVN
coordinate system instead of
XYZ
coordinate system when adjusting the parametric value, allowing you to define the orientation of the deformed objects at a specific point in relation to the target surface. For more information on the UVN coordiante system, click

Tip
To avoid unwanted deformations or inaccurate placement, use the
Unwrap Face
command from the Command Palette on the target object. This generates a correctly mapped surface, which can then be used as an accurate reference face.
