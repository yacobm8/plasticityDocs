Fillet or chamfer the Edges which can be conic or G2 continuous. Variable distance, limit range are adjustable.
Basic Usage
Select the Edges to fillet or chamfer.
When one or more Edges are selected, the default command,
Fillet
, is automatically executed.
Alternatively, press the shortcut key
B
to excute.
Move the yellow dot to specify the distance of the fillet or chamfer.
Positive movement:  results in a fillet.
Negative movement: results in a chamfer.

Ctrl
+ click again.
Set the options in the Command Dialog and Keyboard Shortcuts. See
Fillet options

Shape:
Conic:
The Conic fillet option is known for producing a more natural and smooth transition compared to traditional round fillets. This makes it especially useful in applications where aerodynamics or aesthetics are crucial.
Chordal:
The hallmark of a Chordal fillet is that it maintains a constant length for the chord of the fillet, regardless of the angles being filleted. This uniformity can be particularly beneficial when aiming for visual consistency across different parts of a model.
G2:
The G2 option generates curves that are smoothly continuous with the surfaces at both ends of the fillet. This setting is optimal for intricate designs and complex surface handling that require an extremely smooth and natural shape transition. See
Surface Continuity
.
Full:
The full option will create a rounded fillet shape on either side of a face with 2 edges selected. The operation differs from a regular clamping effect when filleting. The round fillet is a surface that is tangential to all 3 neighbouring faces (left, centre, and right faces) and thus will result in generating perfect round fillet depending on the diameter or distance of neighbouring faces and edges.

Y-Blend:
The ‚ÄúY-blend‚Äù is a special kind of blend or fillet that occurs when three surfaces meet at a common point, forming a ‚ÄúY‚Äù shape. Enabling

, you can create better topology  in Y-blend and avoid undesired fillet results.
