Note
The "Pipe" command is NOT for creating dimensionally accurate pipes.
It is for quickly creating cool looking pipes/tubes.
It does a lot of things like angles as polygons that make it not dimensionally accurate for any kind of plumbing or whatever.
To create a precise pipe, use the
Sweep
command
