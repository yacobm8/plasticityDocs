Introduction of Blender Bridge
The Blender Bridge is a feature that allows for the rapid transfer of mesh data from Plasticity to Blender. This is realized as a Blender add-on. Once you've connected, you can just click refresh, and data is loaded really quickly. You don't need to worry about exporting to a temporary file and getting all the setting options right.
Even if you modify the geometry in Plasticity, the materials set in Blender are preserved. Additionally, the group structure in Plasticity is reflected as a collection in Blender. In this process, Blender's hierarchy is created using the Plasticity document name as an identifier. Therefore, multiple Plasticity documents can be incorporated into a single Blender document.
There's also a live link feature. The live link is a really cool feature; you can see stuff being updated in real time. The real workhorse of the Blender Bridge is the ability to quickly get assets in, so you can see them using Blender materials, Blender lighting, Ray tracing. You can view your objects in a scene with the real camera that might be used in a game or in a final render, with a specific FOV. You get the full power of Blender, including parenting things to empties, so you can animate them, rig them, and see if your mechanical parts fit together.
The workflow is also a fantastic experience. After placing the Plasticity document in the Blender scene, you can still change the faceting settings. Almost all of Plasticity's faceting tools are available within Blender. This means you can quickly get the polygon density or edge flow needed for your model, resulting in a faster workflow.
The specification of UV seams and sharps in Blender is not retained in the current version. However, the Blender add-on comes with features that automatically mark edges, automatically select geometry corresponding to Plasticity faces or edges, and merge UV seams. These features also contribute to a faster workflow.
