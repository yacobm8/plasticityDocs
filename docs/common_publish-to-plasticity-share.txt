Uploads a .plasticity file to the cloud and generates a unique private URL that opens in a new browser tab. The link can be shared with anyone for read-only viewing. Once the link is distributed it becomes public. Each uploaded document supports multiple revisions; you can manage and delete these revisions on the
Plasticity Share
(opens in a new tab)
page.

Only the mesh representation of the model is published so no CAD geometry or source files are included and the file cannot be downloaded.
The feature is disabled by default. Enable it via
