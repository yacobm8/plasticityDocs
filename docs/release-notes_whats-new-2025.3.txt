Release date: December 15, 2025
Plasticity 25.3 Release Notes
Plasticity 25.3 delivers a comprehensive set of updates aimed at streamlining surface modelling, precision editing, and overall workflow efficiency. The update adds live instance creation and realization, radial measurement and ellipse tools, automatic pivot adjustments, and real time curvature and continuity feedback, while also refining array, mirror, and sweep functionalities and workflows.
Users can benefit from the edge manipulation on cylindrical and conical surfaces, drag and drop material handling, faster navigation, new OBJ export options for topology control and expanded language support. Below is a detailed overview of the updates:
1. New Commands
Create Instance Command
Instance Workflow
The
Create Instance
command creates live instances of Solids, Sheets, Curves, and Groups referencing the original geometry. This approach avoids duplicating mesh data, keeps models lightweight, and ensures that any modification to the parent object propagates automatically to all its instances.

Create Solid and Sheet Instance
and
Create Curve Instance
Realize Instances Command
From Instance to Real Body
The
Realize Instances
command converts selected instance objects into editable real bodies, giving you full control over the resulting geometry in Plasticity.

Realize Curve Instances
Publish to Plasticity Share Command
Upload and Share (.plasticity) Documents Online
Publish to Plasticity Share
is a new export command that lets you share a web link to your work. It uploads only the mesh data (no CAD geometry or source files), so the shared file can only be previewed and cannot be downloaded, keeping cloud storage usage minimal. This feature is ideal for quickly showing visualizations without exposing the original project files.

Measure Radius Command
Radial Measurement
A dedicated
Measure Radius
command for objects with radial geometry, applicable to cylinders, cones, and other similarly shaped elements.

New Ellipse Tool
Ellipse Tool
The
Ellipse
tool is now available in Plasticity, providing precise control for creating accurate ellipses.

2. Modeling Enhancements
Measurement and Curve Appearance Update
Measurements
- Arrows are now displayed at the ends of dimension lines.
Curves
- Rendered with a thinner stroke, which reduces visual clutter in dense scenes.
Snap to Grid
Scale Gizmo
Incremental snapping is now respected when Grid Snapping is enabled while using the Scale tool.
Snap Point
Spherical Faces
Spherical faces now provide a
Center
snap point, which becomes available when X-ray mode is turned on in
View Mode
.
Learn more
Move Tool
Solid and Sheet Edge Manipulation
Moving an edge of a solid or sheet body now supports circular edges on cylindrical and conical faces. The operation preserves the analytical geometry of those faces. You can manipulate both interior and exterior surface edges, provided the adjacent faces are planar, cylindrical, or conical and the moving edge is a line or a circle.

Pivot Point
Automatic Pivot Adjustment
Automatically orients the pivot point along the surface normal at the location where a primitive or sketch object is first placed. The tools affected are listed below.

3. General Improvements
Mouse Navigation
Navigation
The mousewheel zoom has been tweaked to be faster when navigating through scenes. This adjustment makes it easier to zoom in on details, especially when working with large scenes.
Performance
Curves
- Optimizations have been made for scenes with lots of intersecting curves.
Snap to OBJ Files
- Snapping to OBJ files has been optimized and responsive when snapping to face and vertex.
Localization
New Languages
Plasticity now lets you set up to
6
preferred languages in the
Preferences
section. Additional languages are planned for near future releases.

4. New Features
Export and Import
Export SVG
It is now possible to export SVG files from Plasticity.
Learn more
Render Mode
New Default HDRI
New default environment HDRI has been added to the collection in
Render Mode
and is available when it is enabled.
Assets Menu
New PBR Material
A new material called
Cathedral Tile
has been added to the Physical Material Library in Plasticity.
Highlight Indicator
Hovering over a material in the
Assets
tab highlights every item that uses that material in the viewport.
Drag and Drop Material
You can now drag a physical material from the
Material Library
in the
Assets
menu directly onto an object in the viewport. It's a feature that wasn't available in earlier versions of Plasticity.

Export OBJ
Remove Small Features
This option lets you define a range that will remove surface details based on the numerical value. It's especially handy for high-poly to low-poly workflows, where texture baking and topology optimisation is involved, or any general mesh cleanup.
Simplify Radial Surfaces
When possible, this feature simplifies radial geometry and aligns edge flow so that edges remain continuous rather than broken. It works best on relatively simple shapes; complex geometry may not always achieve perfect results.
Ngon optimization
If the topology mode is set to
Ngons
, enabling
Convex Ngons Only
prevents the creation of concave ngons. This helps when exporting to applications such as RizomUV, 3ds Max, etc., which struggle with concave ngons and can produce incorrect normals or shading artifacts. While the export may contain slightly more ngons, the resulting shading and overall topology quality are more reliable.
Export Empty and Instances
The
Export OBJ
command now supports exporting empty meshes (e.g., STL, FBX, OBJ) and instances. Instances that haven't been converted into real bodies are included in the export. If nothing is selected, everything visible in the viewport will be exported.

5. Improved Features
Viewport
Drag and Drop Material
You can now drag a material dot from the Outliner straight into the viewport. This provides an alternative to the traditional method of dragging a material dot onto another object while staying inside the Outliner.
Learn More
Mesh Objects
Origin Pivot
You can now manipulate mesh (e.g., STL, FBX, OBJ) objects' pivot points and save their location as desired.
Preferences
Improved Faceting Setting
Change faceting density without restarting Plasticity. This setting applies to new bodies and edits; existing bodies will not be refaceted.
6. Improved Commands
Array Commands
Array Instances, Meshes and Images
It is now possible to array instances, meshes and images in Plasticity. Possible array commands are listed below.
Array Commands
Curve Array
Radial Array
Rectangular Array
Make Instances Option
Array commands now have an included option named as "Make Instances".

Transform
Instances and Meshes
Mirror
command can mirror meshes (e.g., STL, FBX, OBJ) and instances.
Mirror Scale on Instances
Applying a scale value of -1 on any axis mirrors the instance along that axis and is fully supported for instance objects.
Measure Curvature
New Command Name
Measure Curvature has been renamed to
Toggle Curvature
. As the name suggests, this command now allows you to toggle the curvature display on and off directly from the outliner under Measurements -> Curvature.
New Panel Menu
Toggle Curvature
now features a dedicated panel menu located in the right side panel. Here you can directly adjust the comb size and control visibility using the "Comb scale" option.
Live Feedback
You can now manipulate curves and edges in real time while
Toggle Curvature
is active, providing immediate visual feedback as you model. This makes it easier to optimize the curvature on a sketch and surface object when working with the
Slide
command.
File Compatibility
Files created in version 25.3 can be opened in earlier versions of Plasticity. Any existing curvature measurements will be automatically removed rather than triggering an error.
Learn More
Measure Continuity
New Panel Menu
Measure Continuity
now features a dedicated panel menu located in the right side panel. You can adjust the continuity comb size for G0/G1/G2 using their respective
"Scale"
controls and toggle the display of deviation measurement values with
"Show maxes"
.
Live Feedback
Similar to
Toggle Curvature
, you can now manipulate curves and edges in real time while
Measure Continuity
is active, providing visual feedback as continuity values update.
Learn More
Section Analysis
Mesh Objects
With the
Section Analysis
command, you can create a virtual slice through meshes (e.g., STL, FBX, OBJ).
Learn More
Sweep
Advanced Options
Sweep
now includes advanced corner type options:
Mitre
and
Round
. When sweeping a curve along a guide with outward corners, Mitre produces sharp turns while Round creates rounded external corners. Note that Round works best with 90-degree corners.

7. Miscellaneous
Shortcuts
Default Keybinding Removed
The default keybinding for
Subdivide
(Alt + S) has been removed.
