Whats New 2024.1
Update Information Version 2024.1
Release date: March 5, 2024
Minor Improvement
Radial Array
Improved interactivity of the Radial Array command, allowing you to directly see live interactivity on the viewport and improving your consistency of work. For more information on Radial Array, click
here
.
Planar Face Polygons
Enhanced accuracy of the midpoint computation for planar face polygons. For more information on Regular Polygon Tool, click
here
.
Export Dialog
The export dialog now has an improved functionality where it retains the last used filename. This means that when you export a file, Plasticity will automatically suggest the name you previously used, streamlining the process and saving you time.
Image/OBJ Import
Introducing a feature that automatically names imported image and OBJ files based on their original import filename. This means that when you import a file, Plasticity will use the existing filename as the default name within the application.
New Orbit/Rotation
Introduced a new orbit and rotation strategy using the classic tumble/turntable approach.
Tangent Circle Command
The Tangent Circle command now supports constructing tangents to three curves or edges. This enhancement allows users to create a circle that is tangent to three different curves or edges at once, improving versatility and precision in complex designs. For more information click

New shaders and Built-In Matcaps
Added new shaders for isophotes and draft angle analysis and new built-in matcaps for advanced surfacing workflows, including the option to insert custom matcaps. Refer to
here
.
New Faceting Preference - "Ultra"
New faceting preference "Ultra" has been introduced to enhance surface smoothness in surfacing workflows. It is recommended for surfacing workflows and working on small documents, for example, a car body. It is also recommended on high-end computers.
Command Palette
The Command Palette now highlights clashing keybindings in red. This feature makes it easier to identify and resolve conflicts, ensuring smoother workflow and improved usability.
Diagnostic Error Bodies in Loft and Sweep Commands
Diagnostic error bodies are now displayed in the Loft and Sweep commands to identify issues such as self-intersections.
Patch Command
Patch Command now optionally accepts an overbuilt sheet to trim into a hole and trim main sheet to align with the end section of the base sheet. For more information, click
here
.

Join Sheet
Join Sheets Command can be triggered with one sheet selected, and it will prompt to select the second sheet. For more information on Join Sheet, click
here
.

Extend Sheet
Introducing a new behavior for the Extend Sheet Command which will extend a sheet up to and intersecting a target body. For more information on Extend Sheet, click
here
.

Point Picking Enhancement
When pressing
Shift+X
, you can now temporarily disable undesirable snaps during point picking on a curve, edge, and solid. This allows you to snap on specific points without slowing you down.

Snapping Features
Introduced new edge snaps "closest, perpendicular, and tangent" allowing for more control and precision when working with edges. For more information on grid snapping features click
here
.

Additionally, new hover snaps are introduced where curves and edges intersect or pierce the construction plane and axes. For more information on construction planes, click
here
.

Tangent Circle and Arc
Introduced new hover snaps for tangent circles and arcs, allowing for more precise and consistent work. Refer to Tangent Circle
here
and Tangent Arc
here
.
Measurement Panel
The measurements panel now displays the angles between two edges, providing precise angular measurements. This update enhances accuracy in analysing and adjusting the relationships between design elements.

Outliner
The Outliner's right-click menu now includes an option to create a group with selected items. This new feature allows for easier organization and management of multiple items by grouping them together directly from the context menu.

Construction Plane
"Plane from selection" now allows using surface CVs to create construction planes. For more information about construction planes click
here
.

OBJ/STL Unit Confirmation
Importing OBJ/STL files now prompts for unit confirmation.
Improved Panel Interactivity
Measurements in the lower-right panel can now be clicked to be copied directly to the clipboard.
STEP Export Enhancement
Enhanced the STEP export dialog to include options for converting analytic surfaces to NURBS and selecting the STEP version.
Warning Indicator for Unsaved Files
A warning for unsaved changes now appears when opening files, along with an indicator dot for unsaved changes in general.
Simplified Pipe Gizmo
The Gizmo for the Pipe Command has been simplified, making it now easy to use and work with. Refer to the example below.
New OBJ Export Option: "Inflexion"
The "Inflexion" option inserts additional line cuts on surface areas, particularly noticeable on curvatures. This increases topology resolution for higher quality rendering when exported to other 3D packages. However, you now have the option to disable it for a more evenly distributed topology control overall.
OBJ Export Feature: Matcap and Wireframe Options
OBJ export can now optionally use the current matcap and disable the wireframe during inspection. This feature is useful for checking surface quality or optimization with high-resolution zebra or other shaders.

Dimension Command Enhancement
Resizing cylinders with the Dimension Command is now possible. For more information on the Dimension Command, click

Rebuild Edge
The Rebuild Command has expanded to now rebuild broken edges on a surface. This is useful when manually deleting the edges with
Shift+X
and Delete Redundant Topology Command don't work.

Major Improvement
Dependent Offset
Introducing new behaviour for Offset Face (push/pull) command which now supports dependent offsets, allowing you to match and intersect a body. Refer to
here
.

Surface CV Editing
Surface CV editing now allows direct manipulation of both trimmed and untrimmed faces.

Raise Surface Degree
Raise Degree Command increases surface complexity by converting analytic surfaces to spline and increasing the spline degree. Refer to
here
.
Your browser does not support video tags.
Nominal Face
Faces with visible CVs now have a nominal surface to allow easier edits in the presence of direct editing. Remove Nominal Surface Command is available in case it needs to be removed. Refer to
here
.
