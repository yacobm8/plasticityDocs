Render Mode
Render Mode is located in the View Mode menu in the top-right corner of the screen. You can enable it by clicking the sphere icon
(1)
. Once turned on, the shading in the viewport will update to show a more rendered look for your objects.
You can switch between Plasticity's built-in HDRIs by clicking on them. The selected HDRI will be applied to the environment right away and updating the scene immediately - though this won't affect the viewport background.

Ambient Occlusion (AO)
When Render Mode is enabled, Ambient Occlusion remains always active. You can modify the radius

and falloff
(2)
values in the Appearance section in the
Preferences
menu. Changes are applied in real time.
All Environment
Custom HDRIs appear under the "All Environment" category.
Installing Custom HDRIs
Prepare your custom HDRI files, ensuring that EXR and PNG files have identical names.
Find the
.plasticity
directory on your operating system and create a new folder named "environment".
Windows
macOS
Linux
Navigate to
C:/Users/<username>/.plasticity
.
Move your custom HDRI files into this folder, then restart Plasticity to apply the changes.
💡
Tip
It's recommended to use a 1K resolution for the EXR file to keep file sizes optimized (though higher resolutions are supported if needed). The PNG file can be any 1:1 ratio, but 512x512 pixels with a transparent background is advised. Both files should be saved with at least a 16-bit color depth.
❗
Note
Make sure you enable the option to view hidden folders in your operating system to access the
