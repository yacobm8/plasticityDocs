Plasticity Essentials
Export Svg
Export SVG
The Export SVG command exports only 2D sketches from the Plasticity document. It works with or without an active selection of curves. If flat sketches lie on different planes or axes, each will be exported as a separate file. However, rotated or tilted 2D sketches will be exported but sometimes will result in unreliable results.
💡
If the Plasticity document is untitilted, it will export the SVG file into your Documents. However, if the file is named and has been saved somewhere in your directory, the SVG file will be saved there if you execute
Export Svg
from the Command Palette.
Basic Usage
Select the sketch you wish to export.
Go to P-Menu -> Export, or press Ctrl + Shift + E
Command Palette
Export Svg
