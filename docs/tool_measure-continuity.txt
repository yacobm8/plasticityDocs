Measure surface edge continuity by determining whether adjoining edges meet with G0, G1, or G2 continuity (G3 is not supported). The command generates Continuity Combs, an interactive measurement placed in the Outliner under Measurements.
Basic Usage
Select two adjacent and touching surface edges.
Type
Measure Continuity
in the Command Palette.
Set the options in the Command Dialog.
Command Dialog
Continuity:
Verifies the type of edge continuity:
G0:
Checks positional continuity and reports positional deviation in your current Plasticity units.
G1:
Checks tangency continuity and reports angular deviation (degrees) between adjacent surfaces.
G2:
Checks curvature continuity and reports curvature deviation as a normalized percentage (0.0 - 1.0).

Continuity Markers
The continuity marker icons provide a quick summary of how well two adjoining surfaces satisfy the selected continuity level:
G0 (position)
- points meet.
G1 (tangent)
- tangents align.
G2 (curvature)
- curvature values match.
Each icon indicates whether the measured deviation is within tolerance, falls into a defined exception case, or fails the required continuity condition.

Meaning
Within tolerance
. The surfaces meet the selected continuity level (G0, G1, or G2), and the measured deviation is inside the allowed range.
Special case for G2 curvature continuity
. A deviation value of
1.0
is reported as
“flat”
, meaning one surface has an infinite radius of curvature in a given direction. This is treated as an
exception
, not an error. Because this lies between tolerance limits, visual inspection with
shaders
is recommended.
Continuity mismatch across levels
. The current continuity level meets tolerance, but a lower continuity order requirement does not. For example, G1 may be within tolerance while G0 fails, so the overall connection is not considered successful.
Out of tolerance
. The surfaces cannot meet the selected continuity level within the allowed deviation range.
