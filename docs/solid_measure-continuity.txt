Measure the continuity of surface edges by evaluating whether the connection is G0, G1, or G2 (G3 is not supported).
Basic Usage
Select two adjacent and touching surface edges.
Type
"Measure Continuity"
in the Command Palette.
Set the options in the Command Dialog.
Command Dialog
Continuity:
Verifies the type of edge continuity:
G0:
Checks for position continuity. Measures the positional deviation in metric units based on your current unit settings in Plasticity.
G1:
Checks for tangency continuity. Measures the angular deviation in degrees between adjacent surfaces.
G2:
Checks for curvature continuity by comparing curvature values between adjacent surfaces.
G0 Scale / G1 Scale / G2 Scale:
Adjusts visual size of combs and deviation plot.
G0 Tolerance/ G1 Tolerance/ G2 Tolerance:
Adjusts the numerical threshold for deviation detection.
Keyboard Shortcuts
